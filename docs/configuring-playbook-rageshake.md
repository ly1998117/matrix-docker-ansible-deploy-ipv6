# Setting up Rageshake (optional)

The playbook can install and configure the [rageshake](https://github.com/matrix-org/rageshake) bug report server for you.

This is useful if you're developing your own applications and would like to collect bug reports for them.


## Decide on a domain and path

By default, Rageshake is configured to use its own dedicated domain (`rageshake.DOMAIN`) and requires you to [adjust your DNS records](#adjusting-dns-records).

You can override the domain and path like this:

```yaml
# Switch to the domain used for Matrix services (`matrix.DOMAIN`),
# so we won't need to add additional DNS records for Rageshake.
matrix_rageshake_hostname: "{{ matrix_server_fqn_matrix }}"

# Expose under the /rageshake subpath
matrix_rageshake_path_prefix: /rageshake
```

**NOTE**: When using `matrix-nginx-proxy` instead of Traefik, you won't be able to override the path prefix. You can only override the domain, but that needs to happen using another variable: `matrix_server_fqn_rageshake` (e.g. `matrix_server_fqn_rageshake: "some-domain.{{ matrix_domain }}"`).


## Adjusting DNS records

Once you've decided on the domain and path, **you may need to adjust your DNS** records to point the Rageshake domain to the Matrix server.

If you've decided to reuse the `matrix.` domain, you won't need to do any extra DNS configuration.


## Enabling the Rageshake service

Add the following configuration to your `inventory/host_vars/matrix.DOMAIN/vars.yml` file (adapt to your needs):

```yaml
matrix_rageshake_enabled: true
```

Rageshake has various options which don't have dedicated Ansible variables. You can see the full list of options in the [`rageshake.sample.yaml` file](https://github.com/matrix-org/rageshake/blob/master/rageshake.sample.yaml).

To set these, you can make use of the  `matrix_rageshake_configuration_extension_yaml` variable like this:

```yaml
matrix_rageshake_configuration_extension_yaml: |
  github_token: secrettoken

  github_project_mappings:
     my-app: octocat/HelloWorld
```


## Installing

After configuring the playbook, run the [installation](installing.md) command again:

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --tags=setup-all,start
```


## Usage

Refer to the [rageshake documentation](https://github.com/matrix-org/rageshake) for available APIs, etc.
