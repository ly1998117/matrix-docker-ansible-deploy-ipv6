# Jitsi Ansible role

This is an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) role which installs [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) to run as a bunch of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers wrapped in a systemd services. The architecture is inspired by the [docker-jitsi-meet](https://github.com/jitsi/docker-jitsi-meet) project, but does not use Docker Compose.

This role *implicitly* depends on:

- [`com.devture.ansible.role.playbook_help`](https://github.com/devture/com.devture.ansible.role.playbook_help)
- [`com.devture.ansible.role.systemd_docker_base`](https://github.com/devture/com.devture.ansible.role.systemd_docker_base)

For an Ansible playbook which integrates this role and makes it easier to use, see the [mash-playbook](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook).
